## Phase 2: Database Schema Creation & Table Setup
**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Objectives
- Create comprehensive database schema with user relationships
- Establish proper table structure for multi-user support
- Implement data relationships and constraints

### Tasks Completed
3. **Set up database schema with SQL**
   - Discovered some tables already existed (accounts, categories, expenses)
   - Created missing tables (themes, widget_configs)
   - Added user_id columns to existing tables for user isolation
   - Established foreign key relationships to auth.users
   - Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Challenges Encountered
- **Initial Schema Issues**: Some tables existed without user_id columns
- **Permission Errors**: JWT secret setting blocked (resolved by skipping)
- **Column Additions**: Required adding user_id columns to legacy tables

### Database Schema (Final)
```sql
-- Core Tables Created
accounts (id, user_id, value, label, icon, owner, created_at)
categories (id, user_id, value, label, icon, color, threshold, created_at)
themes (id, user_id, name, primary_hue, primary_saturation, primary_lightness, background_hue, background_saturation, background_lightness, accent_hue, accent_saturation, accent_lightness, radius, created_at)
expenses (id, user_id, description, amount, date, category_id, account_id, receipt_image, created_at)
widget_configs (id, user_id, type, title, filters, x, y, w, h, created_at)
```

### Outcomes
- Complete database schema with user-scoped data isolation
- All tables properly configured with user_id relationships
- Foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity

---

## Phase 3: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Implementation
**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Objectives
- Implement comprehensive Row Level Security policies
- Ensure complete data isolation between users
- Establish secure access patterns for all tables

### Tasks Completed
4. **Enable authentication settings**
   - Enabled Row Level Security on all tables
   - Created comprehensive RLS policies for all CRUD operations
   - Implemented user-scoped data access controls
   - Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### RLS Policies Implemented
```sql
-- For each table (accounts, categories, themes, expenses, widget_configs):
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own [table]" ON [table] FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own [table]" ON [table] FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own [table]" ON [table] FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own [table]" ON [table] FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### User Registration System
- **Automatic User Provisioning**: Created trigger function for new user registration
- **Default Data Creation**: New users automatically receive default categories, accounts, and themes
- **Data Cleanup**: CASCADE delete policies ensure user data cleanup on account deletion

### Outcomes
- Complete data security with user isolation
- Comprehensive access control policies
- Automatic user onboarding with default data

- Verify production readiness of authentication system

### Tasks Completed
5. **Enable realtime subscriptions**
   - Discovered Supabase Realtime shows "Coming Soon" in dashboard
   - Documented current limitation and workaround solutions
   - Confirmed cloud storage functionality without real-time updates
   - Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (with limitations noted)

6. **Test the setup**
   - Successfully started development server with Supabase integration
   - Verified authentication UI appears in application
   - Tested user registration and login functionality
   - Confirmed data isolation between users
   - Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Authentication Features Verified
- ‚úÖ Email/password authentication working
- ‚úÖ User registration with automatic default data creation
- ‚úÖ Login/logout functionality
- ‚úÖ User session management
- ‚úÖ Data isolation (users only see their own data)
- ‚úÖ Cross-device data access through cloud storage

### Limitations Identified
- ‚è≥ Supabase Realtime not yet available (shows "Coming Soon")
- ‚úÖ Manual page refresh required for cross-device sync
- ‚úÖ Service worker provides offline capabilities as workaround

### Outcomes
