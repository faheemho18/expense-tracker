  - [x] Close button with proper styling
- [x] **Enhance camera selection hook** (`src/hooks/use-camera-selection.tsx`)
  - [x] Add document capture presets with higher resolution
  - [x] Enhanced camera constraints for receipt mode
  - [x] Support for document mode optimization
- [x] **Add camera types** (`src/lib/types.ts`)
  - [x] CameraMode type (receipt vs general)
  - [x] CameraOptions interface
  - [x] FlashState and CameraPreset types

### Phase 2: Receipt Optimization ðŸ“¸ (Priority)
- [x] **Add document alignment features**
  - [x] Optional grid overlay for receipt alignment
  - [x] Receipt boundary detection guides with center focus area
- [x] **Implement flash control**
  - [x] Toggle flash/torch for low-light receipts
  - [x] Flash state detection and management
- [x] **High-resolution capture**
  - [x] Optimize camera settings for text clarity (up to 2560x1440)
  - [x] Document-focused auto-focus mode

### Phase 3: Image Preprocessing ðŸ”§ (Enhancement)
- [x] **Create image processor service** (`src/lib/receipt-image-processor.ts`)
  - [x] Contrast enhancement for OCR
  - [x] Image quality validation and scoring
  - [x] Optimal sizing for OCR processing
  - [x] Quality recommendations system
- [x] **Add image processing integration**
  - [x] Automatic image enhancement before OCR
  - [x] Quality feedback to user
  - [x] Fallback to original image if processing fails

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish âœ¨ (Final)
- [x] **Update expense form integration** (`src/components/expenses/add-expense-sheet.tsx`)
  - [x] Replace current camera with full-screen trigger
  - [x] Maintain existing OCR workflow
  - [x] Add loading states and processing feedback
  - [x] Integrate image preprocessing before OCR
- [x] **Polish & UX enhancements**
  - [x] Smooth animations and transitions
  - [x] Haptic feedback for mobile interactions
  - [x] Error handling and user feedback
  - [x] Loading indicators during image processing

## ðŸ“± **Key Features**

### Full-Screen Camera Interface
- **Full viewport coverage** - Camera takes entire screen space
- **Clean dark interface** - Minimal distractions, focus on capture
- **Large capture button** - Circular button in center (like WhatsApp)
- **Touch-optimized controls** - Large hit targets for mobile

### Receipt-Specific Optimizations
- **High resolution** - 1920x1080+ for better text recognition
- **Document mode** - Auto-focus optimized for close-up text
- **Flash control** - Toggle for low-light receipt capture
- **Alignment guides** - Optional grid overlay for better framing

### OCR Integration
- **Leverage existing system** - Use current Google AI OCR (works well)
- **Enhanced image quality** - Better input = better OCR results
- **Preview workflow** - User confirms image before processing
- **Auto-fill integration** - Seamless form population

## ðŸ›  **Technical Architecture**

### Component Structure
```
components/camera/
â”œâ”€â”€ full-screen-camera.tsx      # Main full-screen camera component
â”œâ”€â”€ camera-controls.tsx         # Flash, switch, close controls
â””â”€â”€ camera-preview.tsx          # Image preview (Phase 3)

lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ receipt-image-processor.ts  # Image preprocessing utilities
â””â”€â”€ types.ts                    # Camera-related type definitions
```

### Hook Enhancement
```tsx
// Enhanced useCameraSelection hook
interface CameraSelectionState {
  // Existing state...
  flashEnabled: boolean
  documentMode: boolean
  imageQuality: 'standard' | 'high'
}
```

### Integration Flow
```
Full-Screen Camera â†’ High-Quality Capture â†’ 
Optional Preview â†’ Image Preprocessing â†’ 
Existing OCR Service â†’ Auto-fill Form
```
