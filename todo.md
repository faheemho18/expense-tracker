## ðŸ”§ Infrastructure & Polish

### High Priority

*   [ ] **Connect to a Database:** Replace the current local storage-based data persistence with a proper database (e.g., Vercel Postgres). This will allow for permanent data storage and access from multiple devices.
*   [ ] **Implement User Authentication:** Add a user authentication system (e.g., with NextAuth.js) to allow users to sign up, log in, and have their own private expense data.
*   [ ] **Create Proper PWA Icons:** Replace the placeholder icons with a set of properly designed icons for a more polished user experience.

### UI/UX Enhancements

*   [X] **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness:** Audit and improve the UI to ensure it is fully responsive and provides an excellent experience on smartphone screen sizes by default. Elements should resize and reflow gracefully, making the app readable and usable without initial zooming or pinching.

### Medium Priority

*   [ ] **Add a 'Notes' Field to Expenses:** Enhance the expense tracking by adding a 'notes' field to each expense for additional context.
*   [ ] **Improve Data Filtering:** Add more advanced filtering options to the expenses table, such as filtering by date range, amount range, or multiple categories at once.
*   [ ] **Add Recurring Expenses:** Implement a feature to automatically add recurring expenses (e.g., rent, subscriptions) on a schedule.

### Low Priority

*   [ ] **Add More Chart Types:** Expand the dashboard with more chart types, such as line charts for tracking trends over time or treemaps for visualizing category breakdowns.
*   [ ] **Implement a Budgeting Feature:** Add a budgeting feature that allows users to set monthly budgets for different categories and track their spending against them.
*   [ ] **Add a Dark Mode Toggle:** Implement a dark mode toggle in the settings to allow users to switch between light and dark themes.
