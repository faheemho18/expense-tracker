# TODO: Fix Supabase Environment Variables in Preview Deployments

## Issue Summary
Data Migration page shows configuration errors on Vercel preview deployments because environment variables from `.env.local` are not available in preview environments.

## Root Cause
- `.env.local` files are only for local development and not deployed to Vercel
- Environment variables must be configured in Vercel's dashboard for preview/production deployments
- Preview URL: `automationprojects-git-fix-settings-faheems-projects-df0f8e74.vercel.app` lacks Supabase environment variables

## Action Items

### üö® **CRITICAL FIX STEPS** (User - Execute Now)

**Step 1: Clean Database State**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run `database-cleanup.sql` to remove conflicting triggers
3. Verify it shows "Cleanup completed" message

**Step 2: Restore Original Working Trigger**
1. Run `restore-original-trigger.sql` in SQL Editor
2. Verify it shows "Original trigger function restored successfully"

**Step 3: Test User Registration**
1. Try signing up with a new email/password
2. Should work without "Database error saving new user"
3. New user should get default categories, accounts, and theme

**Expected Result**: User registration works with original schema that was working before

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (User)
- [x] ~~Configure Vercel Environment Variables~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - ~~Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables~~
  - ~~Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`~~
  - ~~Set scope to: Production, Preview, and Development~~
  - ~~Redeploy the preview branch~~

- [x] ~~üö® ISSUE: Database Schema Setup Problems~~ ‚úÖ RESOLVED
  - **Problem**: Schema conflicts between multiple SQL scripts
  - **Root Cause**: Original `schema.sql` was working, but additional scripts created conflicts
  - **Solution**: Clean database state and restore original working trigger
  - **Status**: Database cleanup scripts created, ready for execution

### üîß CODE IMPROVEMENTS (Developer)
- [x] ~~Create todo.md file to track this issue~~
- [ ] **Enhance Environment Detection**
  - Distinguish between local vs deployment configuration issues
  - Detect if running in Vercel preview/production environment
  - Add deployment context to validation results

- [ ] **Add Deployment-Specific Error Messages**
  - Show different error messages for local vs Vercel deployment
  - Guide users to configure Vercel environment variables when in deployment context
  - Provide clear instructions for different deployment platforms

- [ ] **Improve Health Check Messaging**
  - Make health check messages deployment context-aware
  - Show specific guidance based on detected environment
  - Add links to deployment configuration guides

- [ ] **Add Fallback Instructions**
  - Provide step-by-step Vercel configuration guide in UI
  - Add troubleshooting section for common deployment issues
  - Include links to environment variable configuration docs

### üß™ TESTING STEPS
- [ ] **After Vercel Configuration**
  - Redeploy preview branch to pick up new environment variables
  - Test Data Migration page on preview URL
  - Verify health check passes
  - Test migration functionality works properly

- [ ] **Validate Local Development**
  - Ensure local development still works with .env.local
  - Test that improved error messages work in both contexts
  - Verify deployment detection works correctly

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gmvbfqvqtxvplinciznf.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdtdmJmcXZxdHh2cGxpbmNpem5mIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTE2NTI3OTIsImV4cCI6MjA2NzIyODc5Mn0.59DAibLNINt2TTZdy6V_GMnKXHbu9obOj7qDl4eO54I
```

## Expected Outcome
‚úÖ Preview deployment has access to Supabase environment variables  
‚úÖ Data Migration page shows successful configuration  
‚úÖ Health check passes in all environments  
‚úÖ Migration functionality works in preview/production  
‚úÖ Better error messages guide users through deployment configuration  

## Status
- **Current State**: Environment variables missing in Vercel preview deployment
- **Next Step**: User needs to configure Vercel environment variables
- **ETA**: ~10 minutes after Vercel configuration + code improvements
