## Technical Implementation Notes

### CSS Media Query Strategy
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  /* Mobile chart optimizations */
}

@media (min-width: 641px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Tablet optimizations */
}

@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  /* Desktop optimizations */
}
```

### Chart Responsive Config Pattern
```typescript
const mobileConfig = {
  width: '100%',
  height: 200,
  margin: { top: 10, right: 10, bottom: 10, left: 10 },
  fontSize: 12,
  legendPosition: 'bottom'
}

const desktopConfig = {
  width: '100%',
  height: 300,
  margin: { top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 },
  fontSize: 14,
  legendPosition: 'right'
}
```
