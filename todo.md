## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for offline queue (better than localStorage for complex data)
- **Sync Frequency**: 10-second background processing (balance between responsiveness and performance)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with smart merging (appropriate for 2-user scenario)
- **Connectivity Testing**: 30-second intervals (frequent enough without being intrusive)

### Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data hooks
- Progressive enhancement approach (app works offline, enhanced online)
- Minimal UI changes to preserve existing user experience
- Focus on 2-user scenario for simplified conflict resolution

### Future Considerations
- Could extend to support more users if needed
- Monitoring dashboard could become more sophisticated
- Could add user preferences for sync behavior (if requested)
- Could implement selective sync for specific data types
