# Dashboard Module Fix Checklist

## Problem Summary
**Issue**: Dashboard page shows "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" in deployed environment
**URL**: https://automationprojects-git-fix-ui-43232b-faheems-projects-df0f8e74.vercel.app/dashboard
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Critical - Dashboard completely non-functional

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Debugging & Error Isolation
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Error Boundaries & Logging
- [ ] Add React Error Boundary around dashboard page components
- [ ] Add Error Boundary around DashboardGrid dynamic import
- [ ] Add console.log statements in dashboard page lifecycle
- [ ] Add error logging in touch gesture hooks
- [ ] Test error boundaries catch and display specific errors

### Component Isolation
- [ ] Create minimal dashboard page without touch gestures
- [ ] Test dashboard page with static grid (no react-grid-layout)
- [ ] Disable dynamic imports temporarily to test SSR issues
- [ ] Test dashboard with empty widgets array
- [ ] Verify basic AppLayout renders correctly

### Dependency Verification
- [ ] Check react-grid-layout compatibility with Next.js 15
- [ ] Verify all dashboard dependencies are installed
- [ ] Test if touch gesture dependencies cause issues
- [ ] Check for version conflicts in package.json

---

## Phase 2: Component-by-Component Testing
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Touch Gesture System
- [ ] Test useSwipeGestures hook in isolation
- [ ] Disable touch gestures entirely on dashboard
- [ ] Create simple test component for touch gesture validation
- [ ] Check if touch event listeners cause memory leaks
- [ ] Verify touch gesture state management

### React Grid Layout
- [ ] Test ResponsiveGridLayout with minimal configuration
- [ ] Create test page with basic grid layout only
- [ ] Check if grid layout breaks during hydration
- [ ] Test grid layout with different viewport sizes
- [ ] Verify layout persistence and state management

### Widget Components
- [ ] Test each widget type individually (stats, pie charts, etc.)
- [ ] Check if any specific widget causes the crash
- [ ] Test widget wrapper component in isolation
- [ ] Verify widget filter functionality
- [ ] Test widget add/remove operations

---

## Phase 3: Production Fixes & Optimization
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Code Fixes
- [ ] Fix any identified hydration mismatches
- [ ] Optimize dynamic imports configuration
- [ ] Add proper error handling to all dashboard components
- [ ] Implement fallback UI for failed components
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton components

### Dependency Updates
- [ ] Update react-grid-layout to latest compatible version
- [ ] Check for Next.js 15 compatibility issues
- [ ] Review and optimize webpack fallbacks in next.config.ts
- [ ] Update touch-related dependencies if needed
- [ ] Test all dependency updates locally

### Performance & Stability
- [ ] Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimize useEffect dependencies in dashboard hooks
- [ ] Add cleanup functions for event listeners
- [ ] Test dashboard performance with large datasets
- [ ] Verify memory leak prevention

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Verification
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Local Testing
- [ ] Test dashboard in development mode
- [ ] Test dashboard in production build locally
- [ ] Verify all dashboard features work correctly
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- [ ] Check browser console for any remaining errors

### Deployment Testing
- [ ] Deploy fixes to staging/preview environment
- [ ] Test deployed dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify error is resolved in production environment
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Confirm mobile device functionality

### Feature Validation
- [ ] Test widget addition and removal
- [ ] Verify drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test dashboard filters
- [ ] Confirm touch gestures work on mobile
- [ ] Validate data persistence

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
*(Move completed items here with completion date)*

### Current Focus
**Task**: _Update this with current work_
**Started**: _Date_
**Blocker**: _Any blocking issues_

### Notes & Findings
*(Add investigation findings and debugging notes here)*

- **Initial Investigation**: Dashboard uses complex touch gesture system and react-grid-layout
- **Potential Causes**: Hydration mismatch, touch gesture hook issues, grid layout compatibility
- **Environment**: Issue appears only in deployed Vercel environment

---

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dashboard page loads without client-side exceptions
- [ ] All dashboard widgets render correctly
- [ ] Touch interactions work on mobile devices
- [ ] Grid layout functions properly across viewport sizes
- [ ] Error boundaries provide helpful debugging information
- [ ] No console errors related to dashboard functionality
- [ ] All existing dashboard features remain functional
