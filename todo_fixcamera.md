# Camera Selection Fix - Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Fix the expense recording camera to default to rear camera for mobile-first receipt capture, with toggle option for front camera.

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Created implementation plan and todo checklist
- [x] Analyzed current camera implementation in add-expense-sheet.tsx
- [x] **Created Camera Selection Hook** (`src/hooks/use-camera-selection.tsx`)
  - [x] Implemented camera enumeration with `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`
  - [x] Added rear camera priority logic (`facingMode: "environment"`)
  - [x] Implemented graceful fallbacks (rear â†’ front â†’ any camera)
  - [x] Added camera switching functionality
  - [x] Handled stream cleanup and memory management
  - [x] Integrated with existing mobile utilities
- [x] **Updated Add Expense Sheet** (`src/components/expenses/add-expense-sheet.tsx`)
  - [x] Replaced `{ video: true }` with rear camera constraints
  - [x] Integrated new camera selection hook
  - [x] Updated camera permission handling
  - [x] Maintained existing mobile optimizations
  - [x] Updated error messages for camera-specific issues
- [x] **Added Camera Toggle UI**
  - [x] Created camera switch button near capture controls
  - [x] Added visual indicators for active camera (rear/front icons)
  - [x] Implemented haptic feedback for camera switching
  - [x] Ensured 44px+ touch targets for mobile
  - [x] Added proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- [x] **Build Testing & Validation**
  - [x] Application builds successfully with new camera functionality
  - [x] Type errors resolved (TypeScript compilation passes)
  - [x] Verified integration with existing mobile optimizations
  - [x] Confirmed no breaking changes to existing functionality

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
*No active tasks*

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Create `src/hooks/__tests__/use-camera-selection.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test camera enumeration logic
  - [ ] Test fallback scenarios
  - [ ] Test stream cleanup
  - [ ] Mock MediaDevices API for testing

- [ ] **E2E Tests**
  - [ ] Create `tests/e2e/camera-selection.test.ts`
  - [ ] Test complete receipt capture flow
  - [ ] Test camera switching during expense creation
  - [ ] Verify mobile viewport camera behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- [x] Rear camera opens by default on all devices
- [x] Users can toggle to front camera when needed
- [x] Graceful fallbacks when cameras are unavailable
- [x] Maintains current mobile UX patterns and performance
- [x] Clear visual indicators for active camera
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New functionality has comprehensive test coverage

## ðŸ“± Technical Implementation Details

### Camera Constraints Priority Order:
1. **Primary**: `{ video: { facingMode: "environment" } }` (rear camera)
2. **Fallback**: `{ video: { facingMode: "user" } }` (front camera)  
3. **Final**: `{ video: true }` (any available camera)

### Key Files:
- **New**: `src/hooks/use-camera-selection.tsx` - Camera management logic
- **Modified**: `src/components/expenses/add-expense-sheet.tsx` - UI integration
- **Tests**: Camera selection unit and E2E tests

### Mobile Optimization:
- Touch-friendly camera toggle button (â‰¥44px)
- Haptic feedback on camera switch
- Responsive camera preview sizing
- Proper permission flow for mobile browsers

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes
- Use existing mobile utilities from `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx`
- Follow current haptic feedback patterns
- Maintain touch optimization classes from `src/utils/mobile-utils.ts`
- Integrate with existing error handling and toast notifications
- Preserve all current mobile responsiveness features
